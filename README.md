Dicee: Roll the Dice!

This is a simple web application that simulates rolling two dice.

How to Play:

Save the Files: Make sure you have the following files saved in the same directory:
index.html
styles.css (if you have any styling)
index.js
dice1.png
dice2.png
dice3.png
dice4.png
dice5.png
dice6.png (Replace these filenames with your actual image names)
Open the File: Open dicee.html in your web browser.
Click Refresh: Click the "Refresh me" text or the page itself to roll the dice!
What it Does:

The code generates two random numbers between 1 and 6, simulating the roll of two dice. It then displays the corresponding dice image for each player and declares the winner (or announces a draw) based on the rolled numbers.

Feel free to:

Modify the styling in the styles.css file (if it exists).
Change the dice images. Make sure the filenames match the ones referenced in the code.
I hope you enjoy this simple dice game!
